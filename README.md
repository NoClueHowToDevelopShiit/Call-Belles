<h4 style="text-align: center;">The Call in Call Belles</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Every company starts with an idea, a motivation, a stroke of genius, or something along those lines. I guess in a sense this one is no different, except it was influenced a lot more from experience received first-hand in other companies just like this one.&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Our CEO worked for years as a float, staff, or temporary nurse (however you address them) and she saw SO many issues that could be avoided if things were just done differently! So like everything else in her life, she figures I can do this...and possibly do it even better!&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">So here we are, running this healthcare staffing company the way we think it should truly be done. Keeping the lines of communication open even after the words "here is your assignment" have been spoken.</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">More importantly the preparation work before our staff even step foot into a client's facility pails in comparison to what we've seen done by most others and that seems to make all the difference in the world!&nbsp;</h4>
